# BEST ESTIMATE - MOLE (PUBLIC)

Reliability analyses can range from small to large. Engineering can be based on statistics from start to finish.
But most likely (and preferably) at critical intermediate steps in between. *MOLE* is a tailor made toolbox specifically developed to suit such demands.

## 1. Before you start
This public repository shows several examples of how different analyses can be performed using the existing web-API.
To execute these examples (or your own reliability analysis) please follow the following steps:

* Subscribe at the bottom of this page
* Receive access codes and guidance for use of MOLE
* Receive updates on functionalities through the newsletter

## 2. Dependencies
Since the project is setup as a web-API using it can be done with very little package dependencies:
* Requests
* JSON
* Base64

## 3. Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Bootstrap analysis
* Distribution fitting
* Direct reliability analysis (provided availability of limit states)

To-do list:
* Soil profile assessment
* Parameter estimation over depth
* Random field simulation of soil profiles
