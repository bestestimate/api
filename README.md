## MOLE (PUBLIC REPOSITORY)

##### 1. Introduction

This repository contains the following examples of usage of the web-API *MOLE*.

Please note that before usage a username and password should be obtained via www.bestestimate.nl

##### 2. Examples

* Parameter estimates are often too conservative due to misunderstanding of variability.

* Limited understanding of variability in input and safety in design leads to uninformed decision making.

* Estimates of parametric variability are often performed based on non-valid application of statistical methods.

* A proper variability analysis takes too much time to be easy to apply in current practice.

##### 3. How

* Fast automated data extraction and parameter estimation according to industry standards.

* Application of proven statistical methods and insight in validity of variability estimates.

* Application of trusted engineering methodology according to industry standards.

* Crystal clear visualizations of process and outcomes variability studies.

* Output generation for easy incorporation in design and sharing possibilities with other parties.

##### 4. What?

* Variability estimates, confidence bounds and probability density functions for specific soil units in geotechncial datasets.

* Random CPT generation based on several CPTs performed in the same soil unit.

* Sensitivity analyses of foundation sizes based on probabilistic studies.

* Risk assessment of individual operations to provide insight in workability of designs.

* Interpretation and analysis of performed measurements as input for design.
