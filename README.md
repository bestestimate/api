Reliability analyses can range from small to large. Engineering can be based on statistics from start to finish.
But most likely (and sometimes preferably) at critical intermediate steps in between. *MOLE* is a tailor made toolbox specifically developed to suit such demands. Please read more in detail on [this page](https://bestestimate.nl).

#### BEFORE YOU START
This public repository shows several examples of how different analyses can be performed using the currently released web-API. To execute these examples (or even better, your own reliability analysis) please follow these steps:

1. Subscribe on [this page](https://bestestimate.nl/menu_mole.html)
2. Receive access codes and guidance for use of MOLE
3. Fill in your input files and run the analysis in only 4 lines of code

The public version of *MOLE* can be used for many examples. However, in some cases adaptations might be required (for instance adding a limit state for direct reliability analyses). Please [reach out](https://bestestimate.nl/menu_reach_out.html) in case you would like an added functionality or an update to the API.

#### DEPENDENCIES
*MOLE* is a web-API which means there are very little (and standard) Python packages required:
* Requests
* JSON
* Base64

#### FEATURES
The following features are currently available through the public version of *MOLE*:
* Soil profile layer identification
* Parameter estimation over depth
* Bootstrap analysis
* Distribution fitting
* Direct reliability analysis

Works are ongoing to expand the features. Please check out [reach out](https://bestestimate.nl/ex_to_be_developed.html) for more information.
