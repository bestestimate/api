Reliability analyses can range from small to large. Engineering can be based on statistics from start to finish.
But most likely (and sometimes preferably) at critical intermediate steps in between. *MOLE* is a tailor made toolbox specifically developed to suit such demands. Please read more in detail on [this page](https://joostremmers.nl).

##### BEFORE YOU START
This public repository shows several examples of how different analyses can be performed using the currently released web-API. To execute these examples (or even better, your own reliability analysis) please follow these steps:

1. Subscribe on [this page](https://joostremmers.nl/menu_mole.html)
2. Receive access codes and guidance for use of MOLE
3. Fill in your input files and run the analysis in only 4 lines of code

##### DEPENDENCIES
*MOLE* is a web-API which means there are very little Python packages required:
* Requests
* JSON
* Base64

##### FEATURES
The following features are currently available through the public version of *MOLE*:
* Bootstrap analysis
* Distribution fitting
* Direct reliability analysis (please contact me in this case)

Work is ongoing to make the following analyses available:
* Soil profile assessment
* Parameter estimation over depth
* Random field simulation of soil profiles
